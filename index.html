                In this study, the conventional focus on grassland restoration, which is challenged around recreating plant communities aligned with ideal conditions. This study dives in complexities of ecosystem recovery after oil and gas extraction in the northern U.S. Great Plains rangelands. Through a multi-trophic analysis that compromises a chrono sequence of two to 33 years since reclamation, this study contrasts the reclaims that did not match to the undeveloped rangeland after 33 years have gone by. However, nematode trophic structuring has seemed to be recovered. Intriguingly, despite the long periods of time, the reclaimed soil is still persistent in salinity and pH compared to undeveloped soils. While nematode communities were able to recover, plant communities still seem to struggle against restoration efforts, unveiling the lasting impact of high soil salinity which is holding back the entire ecosystem recovery. This study shows the challenges of getting to where the ecosystems need to be. The hypothesis of this study will be nematode communities will be able to recover compared soil and plant communities will not be able to recover after reclamation.

                The objective of this final project in R Studio is to conduct a comprehensive analysis on the given data of the ecological damages that have arisen from oil and gas extraction. This project will be done by using data visualizations, statistical models, and markdown documentation. This project aims to contribute insights from the data tables to become charts and show how the field of grassland restoration and sustainable land management practices are occurring. Overall, reclamation practices can recover nematode communities but not soil conditions or plant communities.

                Nematodes, commonly known as roundworms, constitute a diverse and ubiquitous group of microscopic, non-segmented worms found in a myriad of terrestrial and aquatic environments. Despite their diminutive size, nematodes play pivotal roles in ecosystems as they interact with various organisms and influence nutrient cycling. With an estimated one million species, nematodes exhibit remarkable diversity in morphology, behavior, and ecological functions. Their adaptability allows them to inhabit virtually every habitat on Earth, from soil and freshwater to extreme environments like deep-sea sediments. As crucial components of soil ecosystems, nematodes contribute significantly to nutrient dynamics, plant health, and serve as valuable indicators of environmental conditions and ecosystem health.

                The method for this project involves utilization of R Studio to conduct in-depth analyses of ecological data related to impacts that occurred due to the oil and gas extraction. The work will be done by RStudio with provided data and methods such as coding. After all code and images have been collected, they will be transferred to GitHub to create an interactive website to show off the write-up, coding, and images. Within the experiment itself, I was given a data set already to work with. The researchers in this experiment must have been able to study the soil composition such as pH and salt concentrations after reclamation. The same goes for the plant communities and the nematode communities. Within the experiment itself, they conducted a comprehensive multi-trophic study focusing on soil factors, plant species composition, and nematode trophic structuring. The investigation targeted reclaimed oil and gas well sites ("reclaims") across a chronosequence spanning two to 33 years since reclamation. Through the study, the researchers were able to collect the total amount of nematodes with respect to their feeding techniques.
