                In this study, the conventional focus on grassland restoration, which is challenged around recreating plant communities aligned with ideal conditions. This study dives in complexities of ecosystem recovery after oil and gas extraction in the northern U.S. Great Plains rangelands. Through a multi-trophic analysis that compromises a chrono sequence of two to 33 years since reclamation, this study contrasts the reclaims that did not match to the undeveloped rangeland after 33 years have gone by. However, nematode trophic structuring has seemed to be recovered. Intriguingly, despite the long periods of time, the reclaimed soil is still persistent in salinity and pH compared to undeveloped soils. While nematode communities were able to recover, plant communities still seem to struggle against restoration efforts, unveiling the lasting impact of high soil salinity which is holding back the entire ecosystem recovery. This study shows the challenges of getting to where the ecosystems need to be. The hypothesis of this study will be nematode communities will be able to recover compared soil and plant communities will not be able to recover after reclamation.

                The objective of this final project in R Studio is to conduct a comprehensive analysis on the given data of the ecological damages that have arisen from oil and gas extraction. This project will be done by using data visualizations, statistical models, and markdown documentation. This project aims to contribute insights from the data tables to become charts and show how the field of grassland restoration and sustainable land management practices are occurring. Overall, reclamation practices can recover nematode communities but not soil conditions or plant communities.

                The method for this project involves utilization of R Studio to conduct in-depth analyses of ecological data related to impacts that occurred due to the oil and gas extraction. The work will be done by RStudio with provided data and methods such as coding. Within the experiment itself, I was given a data set already to work with. The researchers in this experiment must have been able to study the soil composition such as pH and salt concentrations after reclamation. The same goes for the plant communities and the nematode communities.

                Nematodes are a parasite which can be found all over the world within plants and animals. These animals would be expected to be able to stabilize after reclamation rather than the soil and plant communities are. "The reasons for the success of the Nematoda as parasites probably include the presence of an environmentally protective cuticle, facultative diapause (like the dauer stage of Caenorhabditis elegans), biochemical adaptations to existence in extreme conditions, and the use of a variety of reproductive strategies." (Riddle Blumenthal, et al.) Nematodes can withstand a wide variety of extreme conditions, even of course after an attempt at stabilization of a plant community. This is not the same case for plants and soil. "Oil and gas development and reclamation change the physical structure and biological function of soil, often decreasing water filtration and increasing erosion, which affects the establishment and persistence of plant communities" (Sean St√©fano, et al.) Even after the 33 years from this study, the entire function and biological structure will alter due to these stresses. Although nematodes live in these plant communities, The plants and soil are not meant to be able to deal with these extreme conditions such as nematodes are. These results would be useful in planning future projects around plant communities since we can see there will be an impact on them. This will be another environmental issue that needs to be discussed in which policy makers may need to consider how these processes move forward.

                In conclusion, this final project represents an effort to display the ecological setbacks associated with energy development for oil and gas extraction. This will be done through combining data visualizations, statistical modeling in R, and Markdown documentation. The goal is to show the long-term impacts of ecosystem recovery. The findings of this study could help provide information on future projects that may include this type of human-made impact. This project contributes valuable insights to all such as the scientific community all the way up to the policy makers.
